### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-03-sam-ashley-andrew)
    
    Lab 3, part 2 was one of my favorites because I learned how to call functions.
    This lab showed me how computers can help with real-world applications, like
    calendars, or scheudling tools, that we can code and use ourselves.

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-04-sam_ashley)

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite becuase it game me the opportunity to work on
    practival problems, unit conversions. I enjoyed helping with writing the
    code for the fucntions that convervted the measurements.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2025/cpsc-120-lab-08-ashley-and-gabriel-and-chris)

    Lab 8, part 1 was another favorite because it involved calculations, which also
    invloved for loops which I had trouble understand, but this lab helped understand
    it better. I also enjoyed the problem solving aspect of trying to ge the functions to
    calculate the average to work.
